Title - A comparative study of Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches for diabetes prediction

Diabetes patients must continuously monitor their blood glucose levels. They must keep the blood glucose level within a normal range. The deviation of the blood glucose level from the normal range causes serious short-term and long-term complications. The main objective of this study is to help people to identify signicant changes in the
blood glucose level and enable them to take preventive actions. This study attempts to accurately predict the presence of diabetes using several variables as inputs by applying Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches. The model involves Machine Learning in the form of logistic regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree, and Deep Learning in the form of a deep neural network which will help to apply predictive analytics on the diabetes dataset to obtain optimal results. In the end, a comparative study will be done between the implementation of the machine learning approach and the deep learning approach. The existing predictive models were implemented using either of the two approaches. In our case, the comparative study between the two approaches will help us to identify which approach gives the most accurate results. The metrics used to measure the performance of the models are Classication Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1 Score. We believe that this will help to predict diabetes with much more precision. This thesis illustrates the methods and results of the models and provides possible future enhancement.
